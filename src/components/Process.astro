      <p class="process-description">

        project is completed on time, on budget, and with high-quality results.

        <h4 class="process-item-title">Project Consultation & Planning</h4>
        <p class="process-item-description">
          We start by listening to your goals, needs, and vision. Whether you’re
          remodeling your kitchen, bathroom, or entire home, we define the
          scope, timeline, and budget.
          <br />
          <br />
          This step ensures we understand exactly what you want — and how to make
          it happen.

        <h4 class="process-item-title">Design & Material Selection</h4>
        <p class="process-item-description">
          Once we understand your goals, we move into the design phase. We’ll
          help you choose layouts, finishes, colors, fixtures, tiles, flooring,
          and cabinetry that match your style and budget.
          <br />
          <br />
          You’ll get a clear plan before any work begins.

        <p class="process-item-description">
          Now it’s time to bring the plan to life. Our team begins the
          construction process — from demolition to framing, plumbing,
          electrical, drywall, and installation.
          <br />
          <br />
          We keep the worksite clean and communicate with you at every step.

        <h4 class="process-item-title">Final Walkthrough & Quality Check</h4>
        <p class="process-item-description">
          Once construction is complete, we do a full walkthrough together to
          make sure every detail meets your expectations.
          <br />
          <br />
          We handle any final adjustments and leave your space clean, functional,
          and ready to enjoy.
